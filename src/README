# NVIDIA Magnificent 7 Pairs Trading Strategy

A simple backtesting implementation for pairs trading NVIDIA (NVDA) against other Magnificent 7 stocks using daily price changes.

## Strategy Overview

This strategy explores statistical arbitrage opportunities between NVIDIA and other Magnificent 7 stocks (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, META, GOOGL, AMD) based on the premise that:
- Tech megacaps often show correlated price movements
- NVIDIA's unique position in AI/ML hardware can create temporary divergences in average change rates.
- These divergences tend to mean-revert, creating trading opportunities

## Performance Summary

This strategy backtested this strategy from April 2023 until October 2024, 

## Implementation Details

The strategy:
1. Calculates daily price changes for all M7 stocks
2. Identifies divergences between NVDA and other M7 stocks
3. Opens positions when divergence exceeds [your threshold]
4. Closes positions when prices revert to mean or stop-loss triggered

### Limitations

This is a basic implementation that:
- Does not account for transaction costs
- Uses simple entry/exit rules
- Assumes perfect execution
- Does not implement position sizing
